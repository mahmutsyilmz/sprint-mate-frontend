This frontend is part of an MVP.

Rules:
- Build only what is required to support backend flows.
- Avoid UI polish that does not improve usability.
- Do not implement speculative UX features.
- Favor speed of validation over visual perfection.

The frontend exists to validate the product, not to impress visually.
