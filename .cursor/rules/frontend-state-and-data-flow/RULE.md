Technology standards:
- Use React with TypeScript.
- Prefer functional components only.
- Use React Hooks; class components are forbidden.

Code style:
- Use PascalCase for components.
- Use camelCase for functions and variables.
- Prefer explicit typing over `any`.
- Avoid excessive generics unless necessary.

Component rules:
- Components should be small and focused.
- One component = one responsibility.
- Avoid deeply nested component trees.
- Props should be minimal and explicit.

Documentation:
- Every component must include a comment describing its responsibility.
- Non-obvious UI decisions must be explained with comments.
- Comments must explain WHY, not WHAT.

Clarity and readability are mandatory.
