Out of MVP scope:
- Real-time chat UI
- Notification UI
- User ratings or reviews
- Complex profile pages
- Skill comparison or recommendation UI

Rules:
- Do NOT design UI for these features.
- Do NOT add placeholder components for them.
- Mention them only as possible future enhancements.

Focus strictly on:
- Authentication flow
- Role selection
- Matching
- Waiting
- Active match
- Completion
